(ii) The time worked by an employee on a shift commencing before midnight on the day preceding a Sunday or public holiday and extending into a Sunday or public holiday will be regarded as time worked on such Sunday or public holiday.     (iii) Where shifts fall partly on a Sunday or a public holiday that shift,the major portion of which falls on a Sunday or a public holiday,will be regarded as the Sunday or public holiday shift. 22.8 An employer may require an employee other than a shiftworker to change to shiftwork provided at least 24 hours&#8217;notice is given of the change. Overtime rates will be paid if the shifts do not continue for at least five consecutive afternoons or nights. 23. Meal breaks and rest periods[22 renumbered as 23 by PR546029]23.1 Rest period  A rest break of one 15 minute period or two rest periods of seven and a half minutes duration on each day to be counted as time worked will be allowed to employees,other than shiftworkers,without deduction of pay. The employer will fix the time for the commencement of the rest period and this period will not involve a complete stoppage of work. 23.2 Meal break  Employees,other than shiftworkers,will be entitled to an unpaid meal break after every five hours worked of not less than 30 minutes. 23.3 Shiftworker meal break  A shiftworker working 10 hours or less will be entitled to a paid meal break of 30&nbsp;minutes per shift. 23.4 Operational requirements  Breaks will be scheduled by the employee&#8217;s supervisor based upon operational requirements so as to ensure continuity of operations. The employer will not require an employee to work more than five hours before the first meal is taken or between subsequent meal breaks,if any.23.5 Working during meal breaks  Employees called to work during recognised meal breaks will be paid at overtime rates for all time worked until they receive a meal break of the usual period. Provided that where it is necessary to alter the time of the recognised meal break employees may be called upon to work for not more than one hour beyond such recognised meal break without additional rates of pay provided that they receive the equivalent meal time.23.6 Overtime meal break   Refer to clause 24.7. 24. Overtime and penalty rates[23 renumbered as 24 by PR546029;varied by PR584075]24.1 Payment for working overtime  (a) Except as provided below,all time worked in excess of and outside the ordinary hours of work inclusive of time worked for accrual purposes as prescribed in clause 21&#8212;Ordinary hours of work and clause 22&#8212;Shiftwork will be paid for at:    (i) one and a half times the ordinary prescribed rate for the first two hours;and    (ii) double the ordinary prescribed rate for all time thereafter.  (b) In computing overtime,each day&#8217;s work will stand alone. 24.2 Application of this clause  This clause will not apply:  (a) to any time spent by an employee in the course of travelling to or from any yard,camp,depot or picking up place of the employer;or  (b) in the course of going into a place of work for the purpose of starting work,or in the course of returning after ceasing work.24.3 Saturday work  An employee other than a shiftworker required to work overtime on a Saturday will be paid for a minimum of four hours&#8217;work at overtime rates.24.4 Sunday work  Employees required to work overtime on Sundays will be paid for a minimum of four hours&#8217;work at double time.

(b) An employee (other than a casual employee) who works so much overtime between the termination of ordinary work on one day and the commencement of ordinary work on the next day that the employee has not had at least 10&nbsp;consecutive hours off duty between those times must,subject to this subclause,be released after completion of the overtime until the employee has had 10&nbsp;consecutive hours off duty without loss of pay for ordinary working time occurring during such absence.   (c) If,on the instructions of the employer,an employee resumes or continues work without having had the 10 consecutive hours off duty,the employee must be paid at double time rates until released from duty for such period. The employee is then entitled to be absent until the employee has had 10&nbsp;consecutive hours off duty without loss of pay for ordinary working time occurring during the absence.   (d) The provisions of this subclause will apply in the case of shiftworkers as if eight hours were substituted for 10 hours when overtime is worked:    (i) for the purpose of changing shift rosters;    (ii) where a shiftworker does not report for duty and an employee other than a shiftworker or a shiftworker is required to replace the shiftworker;or    (iii) where a shift is worked by arrangement between the employees themselves.24.7 Overtime meal break  (a) An employee must be entitled to a 20 minute paid break after two hours of work past the normal finishing time and after each additional four hours of continuous overtime,provided that such work is to continue after the break and further provided that in respect of this condition,time worked will mean time worked on the job and excludes time spent travelling from the job back to the depot.   (b) An employer and employee may agree to any variation of this subclause to meet the circumstances of the work in hand provided that the employer is not required to make any payment in excess of or less than what would otherwise be required under this subclause.24.8 Time off instead of payment for overtime[24.8 substituted by PR584075 ppc 22Aug16]  (a) An employee and employer may agree in writing to the employee taking time off instead of being paid for a particular amount of overtime that has been worked by the employee.  (b) Any amount of overtime that has been worked by an employee in a particular pay period and that is to be taken as time off instead of the employee being paid for it must be the subject of a separate agreement under clause 24.8.  (c) An agreement must state each of the following:    (i) the number of overtime hours to which it applies and when those hours were worked;    (ii) that the employer and employee agree that the employee may take time off instead of being paid for the overtime;    (iii) that,if the employee requests at any time,the employer must pay the employee,for overtime covered by the agreement but not taken as time off,at the overtime rate applicable to the overtime when worked;    (iv) that any payment mentioned in subparagraph (iii) must be made in the next pay period following the request.    Note:An example of the type of agreement required by this clause is set out at Schedule H. There is no requirement to use the form of agreement set out at Schedule H. An agreement under clause 24.8 can also be made by an exchange of emails between the employee and employer,or by other electronic means.  (d) The period of time off that an employee is entitled to take is the same as the number of overtime hours worked.    EXAMPLE:By making an agreement under clause 24.8 an employee who worked 2 overtime hours is entitled to 2 hours&#8217;time off.  (e) Time off must be taken:    (i) within the period of 6 months after the overtime is worked;and    (ii) at a time or times within that period of 6 months agreed by the employee and employer.  (f) If the employee requests at any time,to be paid for overtime covered by an agreement under clause 24.8 but not taken as time off,the employer must pay the employee for the overtime,in the next pay period following the request,at the overtime rate applicable to the overtime when worked.  (g) If time off for overtime that has been worked is not taken within the period of 6 months mentioned in paragraph (e),the employer must pay the employee for the overtime,in the next pay period following those 6 months,at the overtime rate applicable to the overtime when worked.  (h) The employer must keep a copy of any agreement under clause 24.8 as an employee record.  (i) An employer must not exert undue influence or undue pressure on an employee in relation to a decision by the employee to make,or not make,an agreement to take time off instead of payment for overtime.  (j) An employee may,under section 65 of the Act,request to take time off,at a time or times specified in the request or to be subsequently agreed by the employer and the employee,instead of being paid for overtime worked by the employee. If the employer agrees to the request then clause 24.8 will apply,including the requirement for separate written agreements under paragraph (b) for overtime that has been worked.    Note:If an employee makes a request under section 65 of the Act for a change in working arrangements,the employer may only refuse that request on reasonable business grounds (see section 65(5) of the Act).  (k) If,on the termination of the employee&#8217;s employment,time off for overtime worked by the employee to which clause 24.8 applies has not been taken,the employer must pay the employee for the overtime at the overtime rate applicable to the overtime when worked.    Note:Under section 345(1) of the Act,a person must not knowingly or recklessly make a false or misleading representation about the workplace rights of another person under clause 24.8.Part 6&#8212;Leave and Public Holidays25.

Note:An example of the type of agreement required by clause 25.3 is set out at Schedule F. There is no requirement to use the form of agreement set out at Schedule F.  (c) The employer must keep a copy of any agreement under clause 25.3 as an employee record.  (d) If,on the termination of the employee&#8217;s employment,the employee has not accrued an entitlement to all of a period of paid annual leave already taken in accordance with an agreement under clause 25.3,the employer may deduct from any money due to the employee on termination an amount equal to the amount that was paid to the employee in respect of any part of the period of annual leave taken in advance to which an entitlement has not been accrued.25.4 Close-down  (a) Where an employer intends temporarily to close (or reduce to nucleus) during the Christmas/New Year period for the purpose,amongst others,of allowing annual leave to the employees concerned or a majority of them,the employer may give those employees one month&#8217;s notice in writing of an intention to apply the provisions of this clause.  (b) In the case of any employee employed after notice has been given,notice must be given to that employee on the date they are offered employment.[25.4(c) substituted by PR546275 ppc 24Jan14]  (c) Where an employee has been given notice pursuant to clauses 25.4(a) or (b) and the employee has:    (i) accrued sufficient annual leave to cover the full period of closing,the employee must take paid annual leave for the full period of closing;    (ii) insufficient accrued annual leave to cover the full period of closing,the employee must take paid annual leave to the full amount accrued and leave without pay for the remaining period of the closing;or    (iii) no accrued annual leave,the employee must take leave without pay for the full period of closing.[25.4(d) substituted by PR546275 ppc 24Jan14]  (d) Public holidays that fall within the period of close down will be paid as provided for in this award and will not count as a day of annual leave or leave without pay.25.5 Excessive leave accruals:general provision[25.5 renamed and substituted by PR588738 ppc 20Dec16]  Note:Clauses 25.5 to 25.7 contain provisions,additional to the National Employment Standards,about the taking of paid annual leave as a way of dealing with the accrual of excessive paid annual leave.

(c) A notice given by an employee under paragraph (a) must not:    (i) if granted,result in the employee&#8217;s remaining accrued entitlement to paid annual leave being at any time less than 6 weeks when any other paid annual leave arrangements (whether made under clause 25.5,25.6 or 25.7 or otherwise agreed by the employer and employee) are taken into account;or    (ii) provide for the employee to take any period of paid annual leave of less than one week;or    (iii) provide for the employee to take a period of paid annual leave beginning less than 8 weeks,or more than 12 months,after the notice is given;or    (iv) be inconsistent with any leave arrangement agreed by the employer and employee.

The employer and employee may agree that the employee may take more than 5 days&#8217;unpaid leave to deal with family and domestic violence.29.4 Taking unpaid leave  An employee may take unpaid leave to deal with family and domestic violence if the employee:  (a) is experiencing family and domestic violence;and  (b) needs to do something to deal with the impact of the family and domestic violence and it is impractical for the employee to do that thing outside their ordinary hours of work.  Note:The reasons for which an employee may take leave include making arrangements for their safety or the safety of a family member (including relocation),attending urgent court hearings,or accessing police services.29.5 Service and continuity  The time an employee is on unpaid leave to deal with family and domestic violence does not count as service but does not break the employee&#8217;s continuity of service.29.6 Notice and evidence requirements   (a) Notice    An employee must give their employer notice of the taking of leave by the employee under clause 29. The notice:    (i) must be given to the employer as soon as practicable (which may be a time after the leave has started);and    (ii) must advise the employer of the period,or expected period,of the leave.
